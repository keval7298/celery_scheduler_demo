Generic single-database configuration.

To make changes to the SQLAlchemy database model definitions, you need to run the following migrations:

```sh
# Make sure that you have imported the new model files into the models/__init__.py file.
# go into the docker terminal
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<commit-message>"
alembic upgrade head
```
